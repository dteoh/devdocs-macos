## Features

- [x] Tabs

- [x] Protocol handler integration (handle `devdocs-macos://`, `http://`, and `https://` URLs)

### Protocol handler integration

Protocol handler integration allows you to control DevDocs through scripts. For
example:

```
$ osascript -e 'tell application "DevDocs" to open location "devdocs-macos://search?doc=rails&term=stro"'
```

... will tell DevDocs to open a new window and search the Rails documentation for
the term `stro`.

The app supports the following commands. When required parameters are not
supplied, the command is ignored.

#### `devdocs-macos://search`

This is for launching a search query in a new window.

| Query Parameter | Required | Description
| --------------- | -------- | -----------
| term            | Yes      | The search term, eg. `stro`
| doc             | No       | Documentation scope, eg. `rails`

#### `devdocs-macos://newWindow`

This opens a new window.

#### `http://` and `https://`

DevDocs will open a new window only for URLs on the `devdocs.io` domain. For
example:

```
$ osascript -e 'tell application "DevDocs" to open location "https://devdocs.io/#q=rails+stro"'
```

Other domains are ignored.
